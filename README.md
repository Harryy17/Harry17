## 🧠 About Me

AI Engineer with hands-on experience in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**. 

I specialize in:
- Real-time object detection systems (YOLO, OpenPifPaf)
- Multi-agent AI architectures using CrewAI
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
- Model optimization (Knowledge Distillation, Pruning, Quantization, ONNX)
- Deployment of scalable AI systems using Flask & Streamlit

I focus on building **production-ready AI applications**, not just models.
